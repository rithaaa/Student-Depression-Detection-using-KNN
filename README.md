# 🧠 Depression Analysis using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to a dataset related to **mental health and depression**, aiming to classify and analyze patterns that may indicate depression.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end Machine Learning workflow**:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling null values
   - Label encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling for KNN

2. **Model Building**
   - Trained a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Plotted **Accuracy vs. k-value** graph to find the optimal k
   - Discussed the impact of data preprocessing on model performance

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – data handling
- **Matplotlib** – visualization
- **scikit-learn** – model building & evaluation

---

## 📈 Results

- **Optimal k-value** was selected using accuracy comparison
- Visualization of KNN accuracy vs. k-value:

> _Insight_: Even a simple algorithm like **KNN** can produce meaningful results when the data is **well-cleaned and preprocessed**.

---

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Compare KNN performance with:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Random Forest**
- Implement **cross-validation** for more reliable results
- Deploy as a simple **interactive dashboard** (future scope)
